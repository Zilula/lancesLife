Yo whats good my friends. Long time to see. Been a crazy few months for me as I began my job as a teaching assistant at the code school I attended. And more importantly the part-time position I started with a Y combinator start up. I've been in contact with the company for almost 4 months now but they didn't have the capacity to bring on board until 5 weeks ago. Trails of being a scrappy start up.

I work remote 20-25 hours a week pushing code to their production app almost everyday. Couldn't be more stoked. I get to work with one other dev who is the lead, a kickass project manager and a few crazy talented interns that were there for the summer. Again, stoked. Soft launch August 1st with many media and marketing events following soon. 

10/10 do recommend. 


Bye.
