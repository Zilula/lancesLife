title: Post bootcamp life.

Well well well... It's been a few weeks? Months? since the last time, I wrote a blog post. It's been a busy time. With finishing a coding boot camp the panic of trying to find a job instantly set in. Fortunately, I was hired by the boot camp to be a Teaching Assistant. For those wondering 95% of my job is debugging people`s code and grading various assignments. 10/10 I do recommend. If you go through a boot camp that has some sort of TA position, I'd do whatever you need to do get a position. Its been incredibly helpful in keeping me accountable with my coding and it takes my mind of trying to get a real job. Furthermore, it is great for developing my people skills. 

Alright. So. What have I been doing in the meanwhile? I took up Acloudguru`s cloud course and hit a massive roadblock trying to deploy a WP site and a simple database. Can't figure it out, Google hasn't been extremely helpful. Not sure what to do next. 

On the other hand, I've written my first bit of Golang code. A simple CRUD API using a [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SonwZ6MF5BE) tutorial that takes you through the process of making a single file API with data models, routes and a server. I'll link the code below. 

As it turns out, I really like Go. It's simple and similar to JavaScript in many ways, but can also be statically typed when you want to define some type of data. The things I'm struggling with the most is managing dependencies and because everything has been in one file so, import/exporting code as a project grows in size. 

If anyone has any tips on deploying a Go server on Heroku I'd greatly appreciate it.
