title: Own it. Every aspect of it.

The past week has been spent working with my program`s career services director who had the week decided to prepare students for the job search. Basically, its time to think about the real applications of a coding boot camp, beyond the code. Learning how to program is fantastic but all of the student, including myself are there to further our careers so learning how to code is just part of the journey. The other part is actually getting a job. 

I was fortunate enough to have various speakers come and impart some of their wisdom to me. Professionals with backgrounds in recruiting, body language, personal development, and industry developers all provide some sort of insight into what we should be expecting in the coming months and how to be best prepared for it.

In addition to getting advice from industry professionals, we also had the chance to work on our elevator pitches, mock interviewing, including the infamous 'tell me about yourself' and even our resumes. 

I found this week beyond helpful. For one, it reassured all my personal doubts that I had about being a younger individual with no industry-specific work experience. Two, working on my resume made me realize how much I actually have to offer to a company and a team. 

Across the board the biggest take away I have gotten was that I need to own who I am, the soft skills I bring to the table and the technical knowledge I have acquired. Own it. Every aspect of it. 

I look forward to applying some of these new found realizations in the coming months.
