What are data structures in Computer Science/Web Development/JavaScript? Well up until 2 days ago I had examples of what they looked like but not how they actually work. Meaning what is their goal? The following will be my definition of a various data structures or general definitions.

Data Structure:
"In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data." - Wiki

"Data structures are patterns of storing data that support efficient operations (think CRUD) to the under lying data. Data structures are built on top of non-primitive data types (Arrays and Objects)." - Lance Merrill
