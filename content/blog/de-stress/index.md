This is really just a post to tell you to get some loving from your pet. I was laying on the couch earlier today when my cat came up on laid down directly on my chest. I could literally FEEL the stress leaving my body. In these crazy times 

I'd like to thank my cat, Spot, for the cuddles. 

Thats it. Thats the post.
